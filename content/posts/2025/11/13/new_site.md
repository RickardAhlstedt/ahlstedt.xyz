## Who dis?

Starting fresh can be somewhat jaring, with questions such as what do I take with me to my new site?  
For me the question is quite simple to answer, **almost nothing**.

## Why leave WordPress behind?

After years of managing my Wordpress-site, I found myself spending more time fighting the platform than creating content.
The constant updates, plugin-conflicts, security-patches, and chasing perfomance became a chore rather than enabling creativity.

As a backend-developer, I appreciate simplicity and performance and WordPress felt bloated for what I actually needed; a place to share my thoughts and projects.

## Enter Hugo

After comparing several static site generators such as Astro, Hugo and others, Hugo appealed the most to me for several reasons:

 - **Speed**: Blazingly fast, and given that I have static content anyway this was a no-brainer.
 - **Security**: No database, no PHP-vulns to worry about.
 - **VCS**: Everything is in Git, even the content
 - **Simplicity**: Markdown, since I already write a lot of technical documentation in markdown, I'm right at home with this one, and it works everywhere.
 - **Performance**: No server-side processing needed.

## The "fresh-start philosophy"

Instead of migrating old content, I'm embracing a blank slate. So I can purely focus on writing and not migrating content and digital clutter, and making sure it works.  

This gives me a space to focus on quality, clean readable content, and better organization from day one.

## The technical migration

For those curious about the technical side:

**Export considerations:**
 - WordPress XML export is messy and require heavy cleanup.
 - Images, assets, would need to be reorganized.
 - URLs will change (fine by me)

**Hugo setup:**
 - Chose PaperMod-theme for its simplicity.
 - Set up automated deployment.

## Moving forward

A fresh start feels liberating, no legacy baggage, no "I should take the time to update WordPress and make sure everything works".  
Just a clean slate to document my current journey in life and as a developer.

I intend to post about:
 - My mechanical keyboard projects, and other projects that I do.
 - Backend-development insights.
 - 3D-printing adventures.
 - Life.
 - Whatever else catches my interest.

## For other WordPress-refugees

If you're considering a similar move:

1. **Don't feel obligated to migrate everything** - be selective.
2. **Embrace the learning curve** - static sites think differently.
3. **Start simple** - let it grow organically and add complexity along the way.
4. **Focus on writing** - the tooling should fade into the background.

Welcome to my new digital home. Let's see where this journey takes us.
