## Who am I?

I'm a 31-year-old developer with 18 years of programming experience.  
I work as a web developer, focusing mainly on backend development. I rarely do frontend work, as you can probably tell by my choice of using a static site generator for this website.

When I'm not working, I spend time with my family—my wife and our two kids. In my free time, I enjoy creating software, designing, and building things.  
Lately, I've developed a passion for creating and building mechanical keyboards. You can read more about that on my project pages.  
My main hobbies are programming, design, 3D-printing, and building stuff.

## Technologies

**Programming languages:** PHP, Go, and sometimes React  

**Frameworks I use and have used:**
- Pimcore (certified developer)
- Symfony
- Laravel
- WordPress
- Aroma (in-house platform at a previous employer, used for websites, e-commerce, and auction sites)

## My Setup

**Daily driver:** MacBook Pro 16" with the M4 Pro chip

**Keyboards:**
- Custom-modded NOS C350 TKL keyboard with tape mod, foam mod, and Cherry MX Red switches replaced with Razer Green MX (I love tactile and clicky switches)
- Das Keyboard MacTigr at work (I try not to annoy my coworkers too much with clicky switches)
