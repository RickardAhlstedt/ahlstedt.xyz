## The Node40

Wanting to push myself even further, I decided to limit myself to a case-height of 9mm and only 36-40 keys.  
Looking at [Corne keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) I decided to try to implement a similar design.

### Drawing board

#### Rev 01

I first started by drafting the layout in KLE, and quickly progressed to printing a first test-piece to just *feel* the layout.

*In hindsight, what was I thinking of that excessive spline at the bottom?!*

This also served as a perfect time for testing out which switch I would go with.  
The choices I had at the time was Keychron LP MX Brown, Cherry MX Red, and salvaged Razer Green Boxed MX from a donor-keyboard.

*My initial plan was to screw in the plate from the back of the keyboard, after consulting my collection of screws, I decided against that.*

#### Rev 02

Fiddling around with it, looking at it, and taking in some feedback from members of Scottokeebs discord, I decided to smooth out the spline and added a spline above the thumb-cluster as well.

*Ah, so more natural in its shape.*
