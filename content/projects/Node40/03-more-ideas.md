## Thin board = low mass?

Creating a rather thin hand-wired board, I pretty quickly ran into an issue, even with caps on the keyboard was quite light and had a tendency to slid around on my desk.  
So I was toying with the idea of somehow adding some weight to my keyboard, and I could either go with metal-spacers or iron-pieces for securing wood together, but that would increase the height, and the internal height is already tight as it is.  
So I spoke with my dad about trying to get hold of some metal and cutting out a backplate and just printing a ring-layer, essentially creating a sandwhich-type keyboard.
