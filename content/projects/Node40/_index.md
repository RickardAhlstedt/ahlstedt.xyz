## Node40 Overview

The Node40 is an experiment in minimalistic design with portability in mind

### Key Features
- Low-profile, case is only 11mm thick
- Split design for better ergonomics
- 3D printed case with multiple layout options

### Design Philosophy

The goal was to create a keyboard that reduces strain while maintaining typing efficiency and being easy to carry with me to and from work.  
I also set a personal goal of creating a low-profile case to push my design-skills further.
